Classwork for CS 3224 Operating Systems

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to operating system design and implementation. We
study operating systems because they are examples of mature and elegant solutions
to a difficult design problem: how to safely and efficiently share system resources
and provide abstractions useful to applications.

For the processor, memory, and disks, we discuss how the operating system
allocates each resource and explore the design and implementation of related
abstractions.

We also establish techniques for testing and improving system performance and
introduce the idea of hardware virtualization. Programming assignments provide
hands-on experience with implementing core operating system components in a
realistic development environment. 

We will examine in detail the design and implementation of a UNIX-like operating system, 
and cover general operating systems concepts, such as processes, threads, device drivers, 
filesystems, scheduling, and concurrency.
